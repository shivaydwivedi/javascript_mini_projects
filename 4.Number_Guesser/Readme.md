# Number Guesser  

**Description:**  
A simple game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the app provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

**Features:**  
1. **Random Number Generation**: Generates a random number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess.  
2. **Feedback System**: Provides hints for the user ("Too high" or "Too low").  
3. **Attempt Counter**: Tracks how many attempts the user takes to guess the correct number.  
4. **Reset Functionality**: Allows the user to reset the game and start over.  

**How It Works:**  
1. Enter a guess in the input field.  
2. Click the "Guess" button to submit your guess.  
3. Feedback will be displayed below ("Too high," "Too low," or "Correct").  
4. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.  

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Add a timer to see how quickly the user can guess the number.  
- Allow users to set a custom range for the number.  
- Display a leaderboard with the fewest attempts.
