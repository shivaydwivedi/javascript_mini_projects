# Random Quote Generator  

**Description:**  
This Random Quote Generator displays a randomly selected quote from a predefined list every time the "New Quote" button is clicked.

**Features:**  
- Displays a random quote on button click.  
- Clean and simple UI with responsive styling.  

**How It Works:**  
1. **HTML**: Includes a container for the quote and a button to fetch a new quote.  
2. **CSS**: Styles the container, quote text, and button for a polished look.  
3. **JavaScript**: Selects a random quote from an array and displays it in the browser when the button is clicked.

**Setup Instructions:**  
1. Create three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.  
2. Copy the code for each file into its respective file.  
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to use the Random Quote Generator.

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Fetch quotes from an API for a larger variety.  
- Add animations when the quote changes.  
- Allow users to share quotes on social media.
