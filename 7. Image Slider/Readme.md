# Image Slider  

**Description:**  
A simple image slider that allows users to navigate through multiple images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

**Features:**  
1. **Dynamic Image Loading**: Displays images from a predefined list.  
2. **Navigation Controls**: Allows users to navigate back and forth through images using buttons.  
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Adds a fade-in and fade-out effect during image transitions.  

**How It Works:**  
1. The slider displays one image at a time.  
2. Use the ❮ (Previous) button to view the previous image.  
3. Use the ❯ (Next) button to view the next image.  
4. Images loop back to the beginning/end when navigating beyond the last/first image.  

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Add an auto-slide feature to transition images automatically at intervals.  
- Display image captions dynamically below each image.  
- Add thumbnail navigation for quicker access to specific images.
