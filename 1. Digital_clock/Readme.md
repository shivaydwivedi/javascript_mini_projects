# Digital Clock  

**Description:**  
This enhanced Digital Clock displays the current time and date with added functionality to toggle between 24-hour and 12-hour time formats.

**Features:**  
- Real-time clock display.  
- Current date shown below the clock.  
- Toggle between 24-hour and 12-hour formats with a single click.  

**How It Works:**  
1. **HTML**: Provides a container for the time, date, and toggle button.  
2. **CSS**: Styles the interface to make it clean and responsive.  
3. **JavaScript**: Implements real-time updates using the `Date` object and handles format toggling with event listeners.

**Setup Instructions:**  
1. Create three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.  
2. Copy the code for each file into its respective file.  
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the Enhanced Digital Clock.

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Allow customization of the displayed date format.  
- Include additional timezone options for global time tracking.
